Java exceptions are mechanisms that handle errors and other exceptional conditions that occur during the execution of a program. Exceptions can be categorized into *checked exceptions* (which must be handled or declared), *unchecked exceptions* (which are usually caused by programming mistakes), and *errors* (serious problems outside the applicationâ€™s control). Handling exceptions is done using the try-catch blocks, while the finally block ensures cleanup actions are always performed. Java also allows defining custom exceptions, extending the Exception class. Proper exception handling improves program stability by gracefully dealing with unexpected situations rather than causing crashes or undefined behaviors.
